This code enables a user to control a Tello drone using hand gestures by leveraging the `Mediapipe` library for real-time hand tracking and the `djitellopy` library for drone commands. It detects hand landmarks via a webcam and analyzes the fold status of the fingers and the thumb's position to recognize specific gestures. Based on these gestures, the code sends commands to the drone, such as landing when all fingers are folded, with the thumb positioned left. The program provides real-time feedback by displaying the hand landmarks and executing corresponding drone actions.
